# ASH — Agentic Shell

ASH lets coding agents operate on other machines over SSH. It is a local Go binary with a CLI and MCP tools for execution, SFTP file access, and persistent shells. No remote ASH daemon is required.

## Install

On Linux AMD64/ARM64 or macOS Apple Silicon, install the latest stable GitHub release:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octacity-org/ash/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer verifies the archive against the release's SHA256SUMS.txt and installs
`ash` to `~/.local/bin` without sudo. Add that directory to your `PATH` if needed.
It requires `curl`, `tar`, and either `sha256sum` or `shasum`; Go is not required.
Run the same command again to update. To select a release or installation directory:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octacity-org/ash/main/install.sh | ASH_VERSION=v0.2.0 ASH_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/bin" sh
```

These URLs work after the installer is pushed to `main` and a matching release is
published. Windows users can extract `ash.exe` from the Windows archive on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/octacity-org/ash/releases).

Installation only places the executable on your machine. Configure a host and
register the MCP server with your client using the sections below.

## Build

Requires Go 1.26.5 or newer.

```sh
go build -o ash ./cmd/ash
./ash --help
```

## Configure a host

Create `~/.config/ash/config.toml`:

```toml
[hosts.example]
address = "server.example.com"
user = "remote-user"
# port = 22
# identity = "~/.ssh/id_ed25519"

[hosts.example.policy]
exec = true
read = true
write = true
```

Replace the address and user with your remote machine's values. Each capability defaults to `false`; `stat` requires `read`. Unknown configuration keys are rejected. Use `--config PATH` before the subcommand to select another configuration file.

Authenticate using keys from `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, or an explicit identity file. Load encrypted keys into your SSH agent and omit `identity` in that case; an explicitly configured identity must be readable and unencrypted. ASH does not prompt for passwords or key passphrases.

ASH verifies the configured address and port against `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. Establish trust yourself with OpenSSH, verifying the host fingerprint through a trusted channel. For the example above:

```sh
ssh remote-user@server.example.com
```

Use `ssh -p PORT USER@ADDRESS` for a custom port. Listing hosts and starting MCP do not require a connection or a known-hosts file; remote operations require a trusted host key.

### Reuse an OpenSSH alias

An ASH host may reference an OpenSSH alias instead of duplicating connection details:

```toml
[hosts.example]
ssh_alias = "my-server"

[hosts.example.policy]
exec = true
read = true
write = true
```

ASH resolves the alias once at startup by running the installed OpenSSH client (`ssh -G -- ALIAS`), so aliases, `Include`, and `Match` behave exactly as OpenSSH does. Precedence is explicit ASH value, then the resolved OpenSSH value, then the ASH default; the ASH host name stays separate from the resolved address. Resolved fields include hostname, user, port, identity files (loaded in order), `IdentityAgent`, and `HostKeyAlias`. ASH deliberately rejects an alias that uses `ProxyJump`, `ProxyCommand`, `CertificateFile`, or `PKCS11Provider`, naming the directive before any network access, rather than emulating it partially. Hosts without `ssh_alias` keep the pure-Go behavior and never invoke OpenSSH.

### Restrict a host

Capabilities can be narrowed without breaking existing configuration:

```toml
[hosts.example.policy]
exec = true
read = true
write = true
read_roots = ["/var/log", "/srv/app"]
write_roots = ["/srv/app"]
cwd_roots = ["/srv/app"]
allowed_commands = ["systemctl", "cat"]
# allow_shell = true          # required to keep shell-code exec once allowed_commands is set
max_timeout_seconds = 30
max_input_bytes = 65536
max_output_bytes = 1048576
```

Roots are **remote absolute POSIX paths**. Empty fields preserve the previous broad behavior. Paths are canonicalized through SFTP (`realpath` of the target, or of the nearest existing parent for a create) and enforced component-wise before the operation, so symlink escapes are rejected. `allowed_commands` restricts argv execution only; shell code can invoke anything, so when it is set ASH refuses shell-code `exec` unless `allow_shell = true`, which explicitly bypasses executable restrictions. Timeout, input, and output bounds allow a request to choose *smaller* values but never larger ones, and configurable bounds may not exceed the compiled hard caps.

Set a top-level `audit_log` to append structured, local JSONL records of operations:

```toml
audit_log = "~/.local/state/ash/audit.jsonl"
```

Each record contains the time, operation, ASH host, policy decision, duration, result category, byte counts, and truncation. Records deliberately omit command text, argv values, paths, file contents, environment variables, credentials, stdout, and stderr. The file is created owner-only (`0600`). Audit writes are fail-open: a write error never fails the operation.

## CLI

```sh
./ash hosts
./ash host add example --address server.example.com --user remote-user --exec --read --write
./ash doctor
./ash doctor example
./ash doctor example --json
./ash exec example -- uname -a
./ash exec example --cwd '~/projects/app' --env CI=true --timeout 30s -- go test ./...
./ash execv example -- systemctl is-active nginx
printf '{"ok":true}' | ./ash exec example --stdin -- elephant receive
./ash read example /etc/os-release
printf 'hello from ASH\n' | ./ash write example /tmp/ash-test.txt
printf 'hello from ASH\n' | ./ash write example /tmp/ash-test.txt --atomic
./ash stat example /tmp/ash-test.txt
./ash list example /tmp
./ash mkdir example /tmp/ash-dir
./ash rename example /tmp/ash-dir /tmp/ash-dir2
./ash remove example /tmp/ash-dir2
./ash download example /tmp/remote-tree ./local-tree
./ash upload example ./local-tree /tmp/remote-tree
```

`exec` joins everything after `--` with spaces into **shell code**, executed through the remote user's shell. For shell expressions or arguments containing spaces, pass one quoted command string:

```sh
./ash exec example -- 'printf "%s\n" "hello world"; exit 7'
```

`cwd` and environment values are escaped as literal values; environment names must be valid shell identifiers. Execution assumes a POSIX-compatible remote shell. Quote remote `~/` paths so your local shell does not expand them. SFTP resolves `~/` against its initial remote directory, normally the user's home.

`execv` runs a structured `PROGRAM ARG...` without a shell, quoting every word literally, so `allowed_commands` can be enforced. It shares `--cwd`, `--env`, and `--timeout` with `exec`.

Command stdout and stderr stay separate, and the CLI returns the remote process exit code. ASH failures print a diagnostic to stderr and return `1`. `hosts`, `stat`, and `list` print JSON; `read` writes file bytes to stdout; `write` consumes stdin and creates or truncates the file. Parent directories must exist. Pass `--atomic` to `write` to replace the destination through a same-directory temporary file, fsync, and rename, so an interrupted write leaves the prior file intact.

`mkdir` creates one directory without implicit parents. `rename` moves a file or directory. `remove` deletes a file or an empty directory and is never recursive; enumerate a tree with `list` before deleting it. `download` and `upload` map a bounded remote tree to and from a local directory without archives: remote symlinks are skipped, and absolute paths, `..`, NUL, duplicates, type conflicts, depth/entry/byte limits (depth 32, 1000 entries, 4 MiB) are rejected before the first remote mutation. A recursive transfer that fails part-way leaves earlier entries in place; there is no rollback.

`host add` appends a minimal, deny-by-default entry to the configuration file. It never overwrites an existing host or an unparseable file; capabilities are granted explicitly with `--exec`, `--read`, and `--write`.

`doctor` validates configuration and SSH trust without connecting when no host is named. For a host it reports configuration, host resolution, policy, known-hosts, host-key trust, authentication, POSIX shell availability, remote cache permissions, and Zellij availability as separate checks, each with an actionable hint, and exits non-zero when a check fails. It never prints identity paths, key material, or environment secrets. Pass `--json` for stable structured output.

Pass `--stdin` to forward standard input to the remote command, avoiding shell-quoting and command-size limits. Input is bounded at 64 KiB and fails clearly when exceeded. Without `--stdin`, ASH neither reads nor forwards standard input.

Commands default to a five-minute timeout. File operations default to 30 seconds. Cancellation closes the SSH connection/session; it does not guarantee termination of detached remote descendants. Each operation opens and closes its own SSH connection.

Each command output stream is capped at 8 MiB and reports truncation. Reads and writes are capped at 4 MiB. These limits bound captured output/file data, not all memory used by an MCP client's incoming protocol message.

## Persistent shells

Persistent shells use a per-host backend. Zellij ([headless CLI](https://zellij.dev/documentation/cli-recipes.html), 0.44 or newer) is the default; tmux is selected with `shell_backend = "tmux"` and requires tmux on the remote host.

```toml
[hosts.example]
address = "server.example.com"
user = "remote-user"
shell_backend = "tmux"
```

CLI and MCP behavior is backend-independent; backend-specific features are never exposed. Both backends map ASH-generated IDs to a reserved remote namespace (`ash-<id>`) and query the backend for liveness rather than trusting local metadata, so ASH lists and controls only its own sessions. tmux uses a dedicated server socket (`tmux -L ash`), keeping ASH sessions fully separate from the user's personal sessions. Shells are separate from one-shot `exec`: shell variables, working directory, and running commands survive ASH process exits and SSH disconnects. ASH opens short SSH connections to control the backend; it does not keep an SSH session alive.

```sh
./ash shell create example --cwd '~/projects'
./ash shell list example
```

Creation returns JSON containing an ASH `id`, `host`, and `backend`. Set `SHELL_ID` to the returned `id`, then:

```sh
printf 'pwd\n' | ./ash shell send example "$SHELL_ID"
./ash shell read example "$SHELL_ID"
./ash shell wait example "$SHELL_ID" --until READY --timeout 30s
./ash shell close example "$SHELL_ID"
```

`send` accepts an optional literal INPUT argument, or reads stdin when omitted. It adds no newline: include one to submit a command. It returns after delivering input, without waiting for the shell command to finish. Input is UTF-8 without NUL and is limited to 64 KiB.

`read` returns rendered terminal text and available scrollback, with stdout and stderr merged. Without a cursor it returns a full snapshot (and may repeat previous output). `--json` includes an opaque `cursor`; pass `--cursor VALUE` on the next read to receive only output added since the snapshot that produced it. A cursor is a byte-delta optimization over append-like output, not a terminal event log: if the pane changed, scrollback was truncated, or a redraw altered earlier bytes, the read returns a full snapshot with `resync: true` and a fresh cursor. Expired or malformed cursors resynchronize rather than fail. Snapshots are bounded by the existing 8 MiB transport limit and report truncation. This is a polling interface, with no streaming or full-screen TUI support and no per-command exit status. Use one-shot `exec` when you need a structured command result.

`wait` blocks until new output arrives, or until a `--until` literal or `--regex` expression appears, and returns the observed output plus the next cursor. `--timeout` must be positive and is capped at five minutes. On timeout the persistent shell stays open; `--json` reports `matched`, `timed_out`, `truncated`, and `resync`. Matching runs against the bounded new output across chunk boundaries. This observes terminal output, not command completion or exit status.

Every shell operation requires the host's existing `exec` capability. No additional policy flag is introduced. ASH-generated IDs map to reserved remote session names; ASH lists and controls only sessions in that namespace. Liveness is queried from Zellij, with no local session metadata to become stale. Exited sessions are not listed. Closing a shell is idempotent and also removes its ASH-owned backend configuration after an external termination. The namespace is organizational ownership, not isolation from other processes running as the same remote account. Zellij startup settings live in the remote `~/.cache/ash/shells/ID/config.kdl` until the shell is closed; this file is configuration, not a liveness record.

Control operations have a 30-second deadline. That deadline limits the control request, not the lifetime of the persistent shell or a command sent to it. Persistence covers ASH/SSH disconnects, not host reboots or termination of Zellij. Treat a canceled or failed send as potentially delivered; do not blindly retry commands with side effects.

## Set up MCP with a coding agent

`ash setup` registers ASH as a stdio MCP server using the absolute ASH executable path and your configuration file. Run it with the same `--config` value (if any) that you use for other commands:

```sh
./ash setup codex
./ash setup opencode --scope project
./ash setup freebuff --scope project
./ash setup codex --print
```

| Agent | Scope | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | user | `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` (default `~/.codex/config.toml`) |
| Codex | project | `.codex/config.toml` |
| OpenCode | user | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` |
| OpenCode | project | `opencode.json` |
| freebuff | project | `.agents/mcp.json` |

Re-running setup updates the existing ASH entry in place instead of creating a duplicate, and leaves unrelated settings and comments untouched. `--print` shows the proposed configuration without writing any file. Restart the agent after setup so it reloads its configuration and starts the ASH server. Unsupported agents receive a clear diagnostic and a manual stdio configuration example.

## MCP

Configure your MCP client to launch the built binary over stdio:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ash": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/ash",
      "args": ["--config", "/absolute/path/to/config.toml", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Client configuration formats vary. ASH serves only stdio; stdout is reserved for protocol messages.

| Tool | Inputs | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ash_hosts` | `{}` | Public host metadata and capabilities |
| `ash_exec` | `host`, `command` **or** `argv`; optional `cwd`, `env`, `timeout_ms`, `stdin`, `stdin_base64` | `exit_code`, `stdout`, `stderr`, truncation flags, `duration_ms` |
| `ash_read` | `host`, `path`; optional `encoding` (`text`/`base64`) | `content` or `content_base64`, and byte `size` |
| `ash_write` | `host`, `path`, `content` or `content_base64` | Written byte `size` |
| `ash_stat` | `host`, `path` | `path`, `size`, `mode`, `is_dir`, `modified_at` |
| `ash_list` | `host`, `path` | `entries`: direct children with `name`, `path`, `size`, `mode`, `modified_at`, `is_dir`, `symlink` |
| `ash_mkdir` | `host`, `path` | `ok` |
| `ash_rename` | `host`, `from`, `to` | `ok` |
| `ash_remove` | `host`, `path` | `ok` (non-recursive) |
| `ash_write_atomic` | `host`, `path`, `content` or `content_base64` | Written byte `size` |
| `ash_download` | `host`, `path` | `entries`: bounded tree with `path`, `is_dir`, `mode`, `size`, `content_base64` |
| `ash_upload` | `host`, `path`, `entries` | Written byte `size` |
| `ash_shell_create` | `host`; optional `cwd` | `id`, `host`, `backend` |
| `ash_shell_list` | `host` | `shells`: live ASH-owned shells |
| `ash_shell_send` | `host`, `shell_id`, `input` | `sent` |
| `ash_shell_read` | `host`, `shell_id`; optional `cursor` | `content`, `cursor`, `truncated`, `resync` |
| `ash_shell_wait` | `host`, `shell_id`, `timeout_ms`; optional `cursor`, `until`, `regex` | `content`, `cursor`, `matched`, `truncated`, `resync`, `timed_out` |
| `ash_shell_close` | `host`, `shell_id` | `closed` |

`ash_exec` accepts standard input as UTF-8 `stdin` or base64 `stdin_base64` (mutually exclusive, at most 64 KiB); set either to an empty value to send empty input. A non-zero remote process exit is a successful MCP tool result. Connection, authentication, trust, policy and timeout failures are tool errors. `ash_read` returns UTF-8 `content` by default and rejects invalid UTF-8; pass `encoding: "base64"` for binary files. `ash_write` and `ash_write_atomic` accept `content` or `content_base64`, but not both. Host listings omit identity paths and authentication internals.

Capabilities grant access with the remote account's permissions. A bare boolean `exec`/`read`/`write` does not constrain paths or commands, and an enabled `exec` capability can itself read or modify files. Optional policy fields (`read_roots`, `write_roots`, `cwd_roots`, `allowed_commands`, `allow_shell`, bound settings) add enforcement; configure only hosts and accounts you intend the connected agent to operate.

## Architecture

CLI and MCP call the same service layer. Services resolve hosts, enforce policy, and set deadlines. The transport interface implements execution and file operations; its SSH backend pools verified SSH connections and uses SFTP. Transport code does not make authorization decisions. A separate shell service enforces the same host policy and calls a shell backend interface. The Zellij backend uses the SSH transport for short control commands; CLI and MCP contain no Zellij-specific logic.

ASH excludes full-screen terminal attachment, jobs, synchronization, forwarding, discovery, sudo handling, and HTTP.

## Verify

```sh
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```

The tests cover configuration, policy, shell escaping, output limits, CLI behavior and the official MCP client/server protocol. Run `ASH_INTEGRATION=1 go test -race ./integration` to exercise a real local OpenSSH daemon. See [integration](integration/README.md) for prerequisites. The daemon fixture is skipped unless explicitly enabled.

Persistent-shell integration requires a trusted host with Zellij 0.44 or newer (the tmux backend is unit-tested against exact command construction; opt-in remote tmux tests can use the same environment):

```sh
ASH_ZELLIJ_HOST=example ASH_ZELLIJ_CONFIG="$HOME/.config/ash/config.toml" \
  go test -v ./integration ./cmd/ash -run 'TestZellij|TestPersistentShellMCPReconnect'
```

These opt-in tests create and clean up their own remote ASH sessions. They cover shell creation, state and output across reconnects, listing, external termination, and cleanup. Ordinary test runs skip them. The host must already be configured and trusted.

## CI and releases

[GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/ci.yml) follows Elephant's native build and release workflow. Pushes, pull requests, and manual runs check formatting, release packaging tests, Go tests (including real MCP subprocesses), race detection, and `go vet` on:

- Linux ARM64 (`ubuntu-24.04-arm`)
- Linux AMD64 (`ubuntu-24.04`)
- Windows AMD64 (`windows-2022`)
- macOS ARM64 (`macos-15`)

The two tests that execute a POSIX shell locally run on Unix runners. Configured-host Zellij tests and the opt-in local OpenSSH daemon fixture retain their explicit opt-in settings; the standard CI run needs no SSH credentials.

Pushing a tag such as `v0.2.0` or `v0.2.0-rc.1` builds four native release archives. Unix targets use `.tar.gz`; Windows uses `.zip`. Each contains the executable, this README, and dependency/Go license notices. A release-wide `SHA256SUMS.txt` covers exactly those four archives.

The release job waits for every platform to succeed, creates or resumes a draft GitHub release, uploads all assets, then publishes it. Tags with a prerelease suffix are marked as prereleases. Already-published releases are not overwritten. Release publishing uses the workflow's GitHub token with `contents: write`; build jobs have read-only permissions.

Release builds stamp the same version into `ash --version` and MCP server metadata. Branch builds use `dev-COMMIT`; ordinary local builds report `dev`.

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py' -v
python3 scripts/release.py version v0.2.0-rc.1
```

The workflow becomes active once this project is pushed to GitHub. Tagging and publishing are separate from implementing these workflow files.
